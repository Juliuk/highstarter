Kickstarter is a super lightweight starter theme developed by Atanas Yonkov in 2020. It doesn't use any frameworks (only custom css), this makes it fast, simple, and easy to adapt to any design. This tiny WordPress theme uses minimum resources to to provide maximum results and the best possible user experience. It features extensive documentation which makes it accessible and easy to set up not only by WordPress developers but also to people with little or no coding experience at all. Fully compatible with Gutenberg but also supports the good old Classic editor.

Kickstarter has just enough theme options to get you started. In fact, it offers more options than most of the other free themes in the market:

- custom header image with beautiful paralax effect
- custom call to action button on homepage
- custom logo
- custom site icon
- custom menu
- nested dropdown
- static homepage
- change theme accent colors, headings, links and buttons
- choose between right sidebar page layout or full-width layout
- pagination
- breadcrumbs
- add custom widgets to right sidebar and footer
- responsive design on tablets and mobile

If you want, you can customise Kickstarter beyond the included options. To do that, I strongly recommend that you do so via a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).

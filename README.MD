Kickstarter is a super lightweight starter theme developed by Atanas Yonkov in 2020. It doesn't use any frameworks, this makes it fast, simple, and easy to adapt to any design. This tiny WordPress theme uses minimum resources to to provide maximum results and the best possible user experience. It has extensive documentation which makes it accessible not only to WordPress developers but also to people with little or no coding experience at all.

Kickstarter has just enough theme options to get you started. In fact, its theme customizer features more options than most of the other free themes in the market:

- custom header image with paralax effect
- custom call to action
- custom logo
- custom site icon
- static homepage
- options to change theme accent colors
- option to change between right sidebar layout and full-width layout

Feel free to customise Kickstarter beyond the included options. To do that, I strongly recommend that you do so via a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).

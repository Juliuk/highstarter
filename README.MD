Kickstarter is a super lightweight starter theme developed by Atanas Yonkov in 2020. It doesn't use any frameworks, this makes it fast, simple, and easy to adapt to any design. This tiny WordPress theme uses minimum resources to to provide maximum results and the best possible user experience. It features extensive documentation which makes it accessible and easy to set up not only by WordPress developers but also to people with little or no coding experience at all.

Kickstarter has just enough theme options to get you started. In fact, its theme customizer offers more options than most of the other free themes in the market:

- custom header image with beautiful paralax effect
- custom call to action button on homepage
- custom logo
- custom site icon
- custom menu
- static homepage
- change theme accent colors, headings, links and buttons
- choose between right sidebar layout and full-width layout without a sidebar
- add custom widgets to right sidebar and footer

Feel free to customise Kickstarter beyond the included options. To do that, I strongly recommend that you do so via a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).
